## Overview

This Portfolio is a demonstration of various machine learning techniques and displays the way in which machine learning can analyse and interpret data sets. This portfolio shows examples of both supervised learning and unsupervised learning, as well as what each method means and how it influences a model. The files are set up in a git hub repository for ease of viewing and navigation.

## Project Options

1. Git Hub Repo (5 marks)

### Supervised Learning Techniques
Supervised learning is a machine learning type in which the algorithm learns from a labelled dataset, meaning that each input data point or attribute is linked with a corresponding target or output value that the algorithm will attempt to determine. The goal of supervised learning is to create a model that can learn from labelled data to make predictions based on pre-established attributes. Training the program to become more accurate in making predictions to the point that it can be used to identify trends and patterns in unlabeled data sets.


2. [Grade Prediction (5 marks)](Grade%20Predict%20Linear%20Regression/GP.ipynb)

[README.md file of Grade Prediction task](Grade%20Predict%20Linear%20Regression/README.md)
    
3. [K-NN (5 marks)](KNN/KNN-Predict.ipynb)

[README.md file of K-NN task](KNN/README.md)

### Unsupervised Learning Technique
Unsupervised learning is a machine learning type in which a program learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, where the algorithm is trained on labelled examples with explicit target outputs, unsupervised learning involves finding patterns, similarities, and trends within data without prior knowledge of correct answers for training.

4. [K-Means (5 marks)](Kmeans-Unsupervised%20Learning/KMeans.ipynb)
